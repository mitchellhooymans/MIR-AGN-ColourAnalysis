\section{Introduction}
Accreting Supermassive Black Holes, also called Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), are incredibly compact and energetic regions of space that exist in the centre of some galaxies. These AGN are thought to play a role in the evolution of their host galaxies with the effect of AGN on star formation rate being an ongoing field of research \cite{cowley_zfourge_2016}. These supermassive objects are surrounded by diffuse material that spirals toward the central black hole, the transfer of angular momentum by the material causes it to heat up forming an ultra-hot accretion disc \cite{shakura_black_1973}. Outside of this accretion disc lies a doughnut-like structure of gas and dust, known as the dusty torus. This dusty torus extends from a few parsecs to a hundred parsecs from the central area of the AGN \cite{netzer_revisiting_2015}. Dust from the dusty torus can obscure AGN preventing these objects from being observed. Fortunately, emissions from the galactic nuclei are absorbed by the surrounding dusty torus and re-emit in the mid-infrared (MIR) which has a distinctive spectral energy distribution (SED)\cite{lyu_polar_2018}. Due to the infrared (IR) colours that are produced by AGN in this way, it is often possible to separate AGN observations from those of luminous star-forming galaxies \cite{hickox_obscured_2018}.Using this distinctive energy distribution we can observe these galaxies in specific IR colour bands, and create criteria to select AGN candidates using the fluxes in these colour bands \cite{lacy_obscured_2004, stern_midinfrared_2005, donley_identifying_2012, messias_new_2012}. These techniques work by using technique-specific empirical selection criteria to make selections of AGN candidates on colour-colour diagrams. In a colour-colour diagram the colour is the difference in magnitude for a source in two different passbands \cite{bessell_ubvri_1990}. In addition to IR selection techniques, x-ray selection techniques are thought to be a robust method for selecting AGN with x-ray AGN signatures often being present in AGN identified with other wavelength techniques such as IR, optical or radio \cite{brandt_cosmic_2015}. In this paper, we attempt to select AGN from the Fourstar Galaxy Evolution Survey (ZFOURGE) \cite{straatman_fourstar_2016} using IR and x-ray techniques. Additionally, we attempt to quantify the reliability and completeness of these metrics against a sample of true AGN. To facilitate the x-ray selections we cross-match data from the Chandra Deep Field South 4Ms Source Catalogue \cite{xue_chandra_2011} to determine x-ray data for sources present in ZFOURGE. This paper assumes a $\Lambda CDM$ model with $H_0 = 70 km \ s^{-1} \ Mpc^{-1}$, $\Omega_M = 0.3$, and $\Omega_{\Lambda} = 0.7$ 
\section{Astronomical Data}
\subsection{ZFOURGE and Supplementary Data}
For this project, the data we used was from the ZFOURGE Survey \cite{straatman_fourstar_2016}. This survey observed over 60000 galaxies in three of the Hubble Space Telescope's (HST) legacy fields, CDFS \cite{giacconi_chandra_2002}, COSMOS \cite{scoville_cosmic_2007}, and UDS \cite{lawrence_ukirt_2007} each pointing covering $11' \times 11'$. Observations in ZFOURGE were made using the FourStar Infrared Camera mounted on the Magellan Baade Telescope in Las Campanas, Chile \cite{persson_fourstar_2013}. Using the FourStar instrument, ZFOURGE observes with five near-infrared (NIR) medium band filters; $J_1$, $J_2$, $J_3$, $H_s$, $H_l$ and one broad band filter $K_s$. In addition to this, the ZFOURGE survey is supplemented with multi-wavelength data from CANDELS \cite{grogin_candels_2011, koekemoer_candels_2011} and data from the Spitzer Space Telescope's IRAC \cite{fazio_infrared_2004} and MIPS \cite{rieke_multiband_2004} instruments. Additional information regarding the ZFOURGE survey, including a complete list of auxiliary data and processing, can be found in Straatman's ZFOURGE paper \cite{straatman_fourstar_2016}.
\subsection{Crossmatching}
X-ray data was crossmatched from the Chandra Deep Field-South 4Ms Survey \cite{xue_chandra_2011} with ZFOURGE data in the CDFS field to allow the selection of AGN that produce x-ray emissions \cite{szokoly_chandra_2004}. To accomplish this both catalogues were imported and crossmatching was accomplished by matching celestial coordinates using the Astropy package \cite{the_astropy_collaboration_astropy_2013}. To ensure that the cross-match is well constrained, a maximum separation error of a one-arcsecond radius was used. The cross-match successfully matched the celestial coordinates between each survey with each source having an almost identical right ascension and declination (See Figure 1).

  \caption{Celestial Coordinate cross-matching between the ZFOURGE Survey in the CDFS field and the CDFS 4Ms survey.}
  \label{fig:Crossmatch}
\end{figure}
To confirm the accuracy of the cross-match, and to ensure that sources had a low likelihood of being mismatched, a distribution of the separations between sources was generated (See Figure 2). Ultimately from this cross-match 593 sources were cross-matched between both surveys.

\section{Selection of AGN Candidates}
\subsection{Mid-Infrared Selections}
Dust-obscured AGN, which are challenging to observe in the optical spectrum, are relatively more accessible through infrared observations \cite{yutani_origin_2022}. In this project we use mid-infrared colour-colour selection techniques from Lacy \cite{lacy_obscured_2004, lacy_optical_2007}, Donley \cite{donley_identifying_2012, donley_spitzer_2007}, and Messias \cite{messias_new_2012, messias_dependency_2014}  to select AGN candidates in each of the legacy fields. For IR candidate selection we use a sample selection of galaxies that are selected via the use = 1 flag, this flag ensured that the source has good photometry, a reliable redshift, and hadn't been misidentified as a star \cite{straatman_fourstar_2016}. In addition to applying the use flag, we filtered sources based on a flux-to-error ratio of 5, omitting sources with high flux error and subsequently reducing the error in the final selection.
\subsection{Lacy Wedge Selection}
The Lacy Wedge uses Spitzer colours from SDSS quasars to empirically define a colour selection that would select MIR SEDs that correspond to AGN \cite{lacy_obscured_2004}. To perform this selection, the selection we used IRAC fluxes at wavelengths of $3.6\mu m$, $4.5\mu m$, $5.8\mu m$, and $8.0\mu m$. Performing the colour-colour selection the sources were plotted with colour axes of $x = log(f_{5.8}/f_{3.6})$ and a y-axis colour of $y =log(f_{8.0}/f_{4.5})$. The lacy colour selection criteria was then applied to each field on the colour-colour diagram. The lacy selection criteria are given by
\begin{align*}
    \begin{split}
       \log_{10}\left(f_{5.8}/f_{3.6}\right)&>-0.1\\
       \log_{10}\left(f_{8.0}/f_{4.5}\right)&>-0.2\\
       \log_{10}\left(f_{8.0}/f_{4.5}\right)&<0.8\times\log_{10}\left(f_{5.8}/f_{3.6}\right)+0.5
    \end{split}
\end{align*}
\subsection{Donley Wedge Selection}
Donley builds upon previous work by selecting the best aspects from Lacy \cite{lacy_obscured_2004, lacy_optical_2007} and by Stern \cite{stern_midinfrared_2005} to develop a more robust selection technique \cite{donley_identifying_2012}. Similar to lacy, this selection uses IRAC fluxes at $3.6\mu m$, $4.5\mu m$, $5.8\mu m$, $8.0\mu m$, and the colour axes of $x = log(f_{5.8}/f_{3.6})$ and $y = log(f_{8.0}/f_{4.5})$. The Donley selection criteria were similarly applied to each field. The Donley selection criteria are given by
\begin{align*}
    log(f_{5.8}/f_{3.6}) &\geq 0.08 \ \land log(f_{8.0}/f_{4.5}) \geq 0.15 \ \land\\
    log(f_{8.0}/f_{4.5}) &\geq (1.21 \times log(f_{5.8}/f_{3.6})) - 0.27 \ \land\\
    log(f_{8.0}/f_{4.5}) &\leq (1.21 \times log(f_{5.8}/f_{3.6})) + 0.27 \ \land
\end{align*}
Where $\land$ is a logical OR operator. In addition to this, the fluxes must be well-constrained.
\begin{align*}
    \begin{split}
        &f_{4.5\, \mu\text{m}} > f_{3.6\, \mu\text{m}}\  \land\\ 
        \ &f_{5.8\, \mu\text{m}} > f_{4.5\, \mu\text{m}}\  \land\\
        \ &f_{8.0\, \mu\text{m}} > f_{5.8\, \mu\text{m}}
    \end{split}
\end{align*}
\subsection{Messias KI and KIM Selections}
The Messias KI and KIM selection are selection techniques that were developed based on the predictions of state-of-the-art galaxy and AGN templates \cite{messias_new_2012}. These techniques when used together are intended to cover the redshift range of $0 \leq z \leq 7$ \cite{messias_new_2012}. For this project, the KI technique is used over a redshift range of $0 \leq z \leq 1.8$ while the KIM technique is used over a redshift range of $1.8 \leq z \leq 3.2$. The Messias KI uses fluxes from the $K_s$ band, while also using IRAC fluxes at $4.5\mu m$ and $8.0\mu m$. The colour axes for the KI selection that were used were $x = [4.5] - [8.0]$ and $y = [K_s] - [4.5]$. For the KIM selection, this technique used the $24\mu m$ flux from the MIPS instrument along with the IRAC fluxes at $4.5\mu m$ and $8.0\mu m$. The colour axes for the KIM selection were $x = [4.5] - [8.0]$ and $y = [8.0] - [24]$. These techniques required that the fluxes be converted and plotted in the AB magnitude system used in the ZFOURGE paper \cite{straatman_fourstar_2016} using $\text{AB}_f =25-2.5\log_{10} \left( f \right)$ the fluxes were transformed and plotted in the colour-space for each respective field. The selection criteria that was used for KI and KIM is shown below
\begin{align*}
    \begin{split}
        z&<1.8\begin{cases}K_{s}-[4.5]>0&\\ [4.5]-[8.0]>0&\end{cases} \\
        z&>1.8\begin{cases}[8.0]-[24]>-2.9\times ([4.5]-[8.0])+2.8&\\ [8.0]-[24]>0.5&\end{cases}
    \end{split}
\end{align*}
\subsection{Szokoly X-Ray Selection}
The Szokoly X-ray selection techniques were used as they allow a simple and relatively reliable approach to selecting AGN based on the x-ray luminosity and hardness ratio of the source \cite{szokoly_chandra_2004}. This technique can select bright x-rays sources that may have been obscured by dust by examining the hardness ratio (HR) of a source. As the CDFS 4Ms Survey was crossmatched into ZFOURGE the x-ray selection was performed only in the CDFS field. The Szokoly x-ray selection technique is shown below
\begin{align*}
    L_x \geq \ 10^{41}\ erg\ s^{-1}\ \text{and}\ \text{HR} > -0.2 \\
    L_x \geq \ 10^{42}\ erg\ s^{-1}\ \text{and}\  \text{HR} \leq -0.2
\end{align*}
\subsection{Truth Sample, Completeness and Reliability}
As selection criteria can be influenced by contamination and incompleteness of data it is important to quantify these selections with a metric for the completeness and reliability of the sample. To determine the reliability and completeness the selected AGN must be compared against a truth sample of AGN. The truth sample is derived from the python Code Investigating Galaxy Emission (CIGALE) \cite{boquien_cigale_2019, yang_x-cigale_2020} which uses statistical models to generate and analyze SED data for galaxies. In this project, the selected AGN candidates were fed into CIGALE which output information about the source's AGN and dust luminosity contributions. Where the luminosity contribution was $>50\%$ of the total luminosity, the source was marked as a known AGN. Next selections had been flagged by the selection criteria and as a known AGN, were marked as a positive diagnostic detection. These positive diagnostic detections were used to calculate the reliability and completeness of the sample
\begin{align*}
    \begin{split}
        \text{Completeness} &= N_{\text{AGN, SEL} }/N_{\text{AGN}}\\
        \text{Reliability} &= N_{\text{AGN, SEL} }/N_{\text{SEL}}
    \end{split}
\end{align*}
The completeness is defined as the fraction of positive diagnostics to known AGN, while the reliability is defined as the fraction of positive diagnostics to selected AGN. 

\section{Results}
\subsection{AGN Candidates Selections}
The Lacy selection (See Figure. \ref{fig:DonleyLacyWedge}) shows a large selection of AGN candidates that were originally explored in the ZFOURGE survey. Present in both Lacy and Donley diagrams are the distinctive "bunny ears" distribution of sources\cite{sajina_simulating_2005}. The majority of selections in Lacy are clustered towards the center of the diagram with sources becoming more sparsely populated at redder colours, colours towards the top and right-most side of the diagrams. Similarly in the Donley selection (See Figure \ref{fig:DonleyLacyWedge}) we see the selections also tend to cluster towards the center. The selections made by Donley also select a subset of sources selected by Lacy, with the inclusion of a few extra sources. Both selections were made over all of the HST fields with the selection being applied to sources that were filtered to a flux/error threshold of 5$\sigma$. Error was calculated for each of the selection diagnostic by propagating the error from the flux error into the colour space and taking an average of the resulting error in that colourspace. These errors were therefore far lower at $5\sigma$ than at lower thresholds (i.e $1\sigma$, $2\sigma$, etc.).

  \label{fig:MessiasKIKIM}
\end{figure*}
\newpage
The Messias KI selection (See Figure. \ref{fig:MessiasKIKIM}) shows a selection consistent selection consistent with the expected selection. The Messias KI and KIM selections are used in all fields. The KI selection tends to select mostly at the center to the less densely populated right side of the diagram. The KI selection in particular tends contains far more suspected AGN candidates than those selected by the Messias KIM selection (See Figure. \ref{fig:MessiasKIKIM}). Additionally, the sources of error are particularly low in y colour axis for the Messias KI selection and a relatively large in the x colour axis for the KIM selection.

\end{indented}
\end{table}
Out of the ~60000 galaxies explored in the ZFOURGE survey 1649 sources were selected as AGN candidates (See Table. 1). The largest number of selections was made in the CDFS field. This was then followed by UDS and COSOMS. The Lacy selection criteria tended to select the greatest amount of sources as AGN candidates, followed by the Donley and Messias selections. The X-ray selection technique notably selected the least amount of sources, with little overlap with MIR source detections. In terms of uniqueness, almost all sources that were selected by Donley and Messias were also selected by the Lacy Wedge.

\end{figure}
\newpage
Using the truth sample from the CIGALE output we calculated the reliability and completeness of the selections. We can see that the Lacy selection has a very high completeness of ~96-99\% contrasted with a low reliability of 15\% across all fields. This is followed by a lower completeness ~40-70\% and slightly higher reliability of ~20-40\% in both Donley and Messias selection techniques. The COSMOS field consistently has higher completeness and lower average reliability across all MIR selection techniques, with the Donley selection producing a completeness of 75\% and a reliability of ~40\%. The Szokoly x-ray selection technique shows low completeness and low reliability with both being around ~25\%. 
\section{Discussion}
The Mid-Infrared Techniques used in this paper show that the photometric colour-colour selection is useful for detecting heavily obscured AGN, however these techniques will have varying degrees of success. MIR colour selection techniques are generally influenced quite heavily by selection biases \cite{lacy_optical_2007}. This is because the techniques rely on the colour of the object being observed to be dominated by the selection colour. We see the influence of these biases strongly when examining the Lacy Wedge. From the diagram (See Figure. \ref{fig:DonleyLacyWedge}) we can see that most of the selections tend to occur where the colours are less redder closer to the centre. This grouping is expected to correspond to obscured type 1 quasars which have well-defined MIR emissions\cite{lacy_optical_2007}. Objects along the rising diagonal divide of the diagram, roughly on the left "ear" are thought to potentially correspond to galaxies with strong MIR emissions of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH)\cite{lacy_optical_2007, sajina_simulating_2005}. These can occur at wavelengths of $3\mu m-20\mu m$ and are known to characterize the MIR spectra of star-forming galaxies \cite{langeroodi_pah_2023}. Due to these emissions, it is possible that PAH emission could contaminate the colour space and thus be a cause of the high completeness and low reliability of the lacy diagnostic \cite{hickox_obscured_2018}. Additionally, as the lacy wedge was not constrained to a particular redshift range, there may have been a larger portion of galaxies at high redshifts that may have had their emissions redshifted into the colour selection. \par The Donley selection (See Figure. \ref{fig:DonleyLacyWedge}) has improved results across all fields, with particularly high completeness and reliability in the cosmos field. The Donley selection greatly outperforms the Lacy selection in terms of reliability while only marginally reducing the completeness. It is suspected that this is due to the fact that the Donley criteria refine the Lacy selection by selecting a subset of galaxies in Lacy that can be described by a power law \cite{donley_identifying_2012, alonsoherrero_infrared_2006}. It is known that this power-law continuum generally suggested the existence of an AGN \cite{elvis_atlas_1994}. This power-law selection selects the right "ear" in the diagram and allows much of the PAH contamination in Lacy to be largely ignored. This constraint ultimately reduces the amount of false positive detections and is likely to be responsible for the increase in reliability when compared to Lacy. \par 
The Messias KI and KIM selections in general showed relatively average to low completeness but a similar reliability to the donley technique. It is suspected that as this selection was made over a much smaller redshift range, this would have affected the overall completeness of the selection, with far fewer sources being detected as AGN when compared to previously mentioned IR techniques. It is noted that previous work calculated by Messias \cite{messias_new_2012, messias_dependency_2014} also observes a relatively low level of completeness. This low level of completeness can be attributed to the fact that at lower redshifts low luminosity AGN are often outshone by their host galaxy in the IR \cite{messias_dependency_2014}. 


While these photometric methods are useful, cost-effective, and time-saving for detecting AGN, it may be important to follow up with this candidate selection by using spectroscopy to confirm the selections \cite{hainline_spectroscopic_2014}. Where spectroscopy isn't a viable option for AGN detection, research is currently being done with Machine learning... [NOTE THIS WILL NEED TO BE FINISHED.
