            Code Investigating GALaxy Emission (cigale) is a powerful multiwavelength spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting code for extragalactic studies. However, the current version of cigale is not able to fit X-ray data, which often provide unique insights into active galactic nucleus (AGN) intrinsic power. We develop a new X-ray module for cigale, allowing it to fit SEDs from the X-ray to infrared (IR). We also improve the AGN fitting of cigale from UV-to-IR wavelengths. We implement a modern clumpy two-phase torus model, skirtor. To account for moderately extincted type 1 AGNs, we implement polar-dust extinction. We publicly release the source code (named ‘x-cigale’). We test x-cigale with X-ray detected AGNs in SDSS, COSMOS, and AKARI-NEP. The fitting quality (as indicated by reduced χ2) is good in general, indicating that x-cigale is capable of modelling the observed SED from X-ray to IR. We discuss constrainability and degeneracy of model parameters in the fitting of AKARI-NEP, for which excellent mid-IR photometric coverage is available. We also test fitting a sample of AKARI-NEP galaxies for which only X-ray upper limits are available from Chandra observations, and find that the upper limit can effectively constrain the AGN SED contribution for some systems. Finally, using x-cigale, we assess the ability of Athena to constrain the AGN activity in future extragalactic studies.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT
            Recent observations have shown that a large portion of the mid-infrared (MIR) spectrum of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) stems from the polar regions. In this paper, we investigate the effects of this polar gas on the X-ray spectrum of AGNs using ray-tracing simulations. Two geometries for the polar gas are considered, (1) a hollow cone corresponding to the best-fitting MIR model and (2) a filled cone, both with varying column densities (ranging from 1021 to 1022.5 cm−2) along with a torus surrounding the central X-ray source. We find that the polar gas leads to an increase in the equivalent width of several fluorescence lines below ∼5 keV (e.g. O, Ne, Mg, Si). A filled geometry is unlikely for the polar component, as the X-ray spectra of many type 1 AGNs would show signatures of obscuration. We also consider extra emission from the narrow-line region such as a scattered power law with many photoionized lines from obscured AGNs, and different opening angles and matter compositions for the hollow cone. These simulations will provide a fundamental benchmark for current and future high spectral resolution X-ray instruments, such as those onboard XRISM and Athena.},

	abstract = {Context
              . Measuring how the physical properties of galaxies change across cosmic times is essential to understand galaxy formation and evolution. With the advent of numerous ground-based and space-borne instruments launched over the past few decades we now have exquisite multi-wavelength observations of galaxies from the far-ultraviolet (FUV) to the radio domain. To tap into this mine of data and obtain new insight into the formation and evolution of galaxies, it is essential that we are able to extract information from their spectral energy distribution (SED).
            
            
              Aims
              . We present a completely new implementation of Code Investigating GALaxy Emission (
              CIGALE
              ). Written in
              python
              , its main aims are to easily and efficiently model the FUV to radio spectrum of galaxies and estimate their physical properties such as star formation rate, attenuation, dust luminosity, stellar mass, and many other physical quantities.
            
            
              Methods
              . To compute the spectral models,
              CIGALE
              builds composite stellar populations from simple stellar populations combined with highly flexible star formation histories, calculates the emission from gas ionised by massive stars, and attenuates both the stars and the ionised gas with a highly flexible attenuation curve. Based on an energy balance principle, the absorbed energy is then re-emitted by the dust in the mid- and far-infrared domains while thermal and non-thermal components are also included, extending the spectrum far into the radio range. A large grid of models is then fitted to the data and the physical properties are estimated through the analysis of the likelihood distribution.
            
            
              Results
              .
              CIGALE
              is a versatile and easy-to-use tool that makes full use of the architecture of multi-core computers, building grids of millions of models and analysing samples of thousands of galaxies, both at high speed. Beyond fitting the SEDs of galaxies and parameter estimations, it can also be used as a model-generation tool or serve as a library to build new applications.},

	abstract = {Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are powered by the accretion of material onto a supermassive black hole (SMBH) and are among the most luminous objects in the Universe. However, the huge radiative power of most AGN cannot be seen directly, as the accretion is hidden behind gas and dust that absorb many of the characteristic observational signatures. This obscuration presents an important challenge for uncovering the complete AGN population and understanding the cosmic evolution of SMBHs. In this review, we describe a broad range of multiwavelength techniques that are currently being employed to identify obscured AGN, and we assess the reliability and completeness of each technique. We follow with a discussion of the demographics of obscured AGN activity, explore the nature and physical scales of the obscuring material, and assess the implications of obscured AGN for observational cosmology. We conclude with an outline of the prospects for future progress from both observations and theoretical models, and we highlight some of the key outstanding questions.},

              , we find that high density regions consist of elevated stellar masses but require more complete samples of quiescent and sSFR data to study the effects of environment in more detail at these higher redshifts. Overall, our results suggest that well-evolved, passive galaxies are already in place in high density environments at
