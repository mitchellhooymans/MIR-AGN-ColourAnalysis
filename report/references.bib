              Dust-obscured galaxies (DOGs), which are observationally characterized as faint in the optical and bright in the infrared, are the final stage of galaxy mergers and are essential objects in the evolution of galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGNs). However, the relationship between the torus-scale gas dynamics around AGNs and the DOGs’ lifetime remains unclear. We obtained the evolution of the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of a galaxy merger system with AGN feedback from postprocessed pseudo-observations based on an
              N
              -body/smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulation. We focused on a late-stage merger of two identical galaxies with a supermassive black hole (SMBH) of 10
              8
              M
              ⊙
              . We found that the infrared luminosity of the system reaches ultra- and hyperluminous infrared galaxy classes (10
              12
              and 10
              13
              L
              ⊙
              , respectively). The DOG phase corresponds to a state in which the AGNs are buried in dense gas and dust, with the infrared luminosity exceeding 3.3 × 10
              12
              L
              ⊙
              . We also identified subcategories of DOGs, namely bump and power-law DOGs, from the SEDs and their evolution. The bump DOGs tend to evolve to power-law DOGs over several Myrs. We found that contribution from the hot dust around the nucleus in the infrared radiation is essential for identifying the system as a power-law DOG; the gas and dust are distributed nonspherically around the nucleus, therefore, the observed properties of DOGs depend on the viewing angle. In our model, the lifetime of merger-driven DOGs is less than 4 Myr, suggesting that the observed DOG phase is a brief aspect of galaxy mergers.},

It focuses on new ideas about the origin and properties of the central obscurer (torus) and the connection to its surroundings. The review does not address radio unification. AGN tori must be clumpy but uncertainties about their properties persist. Today's most promising models involve disk winds of various types and hydrodynamic simulations that link the large-scale galactic disk to the inner accretion flow. Infrared (IR) studies greatly improved our understanding of the spectral energy distribution of AGNs, but they are hindered by various selection effects. X-ray samples are more complete. The dependence of the covering factor of the torus on luminosity is a basic relationship that remains unexplained. There is also much confusion regarding real type-II AGNs, which do not fit into a simple unification scheme. The most impressive recent results are due to IR interferometry, which is not in accord with most torus models, and the accurate mapping of central ionization cones. AGN unification may not apply to merging systems and is possibly restricted to secularly evolving galaxies.},

	abstract = {Summary. The outward transfer of the angular momentum of the accreting matter leads to the formation of a disk around the black hole. The structure and radiation spectrum of the disk depend, mainly on the rate of matter inflow A into the disk at its external boundary The dependence on the efficiency of mechanisms of angular momentum transport (connected with the magnetic field and turbulence) is weaker. If A = 1O- 3.1O-8 M0 the disk around the black hole is a year powerful source of X-ray radiation with hv 1- 10 keV and luminosity L 1O - 1038 erg/s. If the flux of the accreting matter decreases, the effective temperature of the radiation and the luminosity will drop. On the other hand, when M {\textgreater} 1O- M0 the optical luminosity year of the disk exceeds the solar value. The main contribution to the optical luminosity of the black hole arises from reradiation of that part of the X-ray and ultra-violet energy which is initially produced in the central high temperature regions of the disk and which is then absorbed by the low temperature outer regions. saturated by broad recombination and resonance emission lines. Variability, connected with the character of the motion of the black hole, with gas flows in a binary system and with eclipses, is possible. Under certain conditions, the hard radiation can evaporate the gas. This can counteract the matter inflow into the disk and lead to autoregulation of the accretion. If M 3. 10-8M0 the luminosity of the disk around year the black hole is stabilized at the critical level of L 1038 M erg A small fraction of the accreting M0 s matter falls under the gravitational radius whereas the major part of it flows out with high velocity from the central regions of the disk. The outfiowing matter is opaque to the disk radiation and completely transforms its spectrum. In consequence, at the supercritical regime of accretion the black hole may appear as a bright, hot, optical star with a strong outflow of matter Key words: black holes - binary systems - X-ray sources - accretion The optical radiation spectrum of such objects must be},

            Code Investigating GALaxy Emission (cigale) is a powerful multiwavelength spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting code for extragalactic studies. However, the current version of cigale is not able to fit X-ray data, which often provide unique insights into active galactic nucleus (AGN) intrinsic power. We develop a new X-ray module for cigale, allowing it to fit SEDs from the X-ray to infrared (IR). We also improve the AGN fitting of cigale from UV-to-IR wavelengths. We implement a modern clumpy two-phase torus model, skirtor. To account for moderately extincted type 1 AGNs, we implement polar-dust extinction. We publicly release the source code (named ‘x-cigale’). We test x-cigale with X-ray detected AGNs in SDSS, COSMOS, and AKARI-NEP. The fitting quality (as indicated by reduced χ2) is good in general, indicating that x-cigale is capable of modelling the observed SED from X-ray to IR. We discuss constrainability and degeneracy of model parameters in the fitting of AKARI-NEP, for which excellent mid-IR photometric coverage is available. We also test fitting a sample of AKARI-NEP galaxies for which only X-ray upper limits are available from Chandra observations, and find that the upper limit can effectively constrain the AGN SED contribution for some systems. Finally, using x-cigale, we assess the ability of Athena to constrain the AGN activity in future extragalactic studies.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT
            Recent observations have shown that a large portion of the mid-infrared (MIR) spectrum of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) stems from the polar regions. In this paper, we investigate the effects of this polar gas on the X-ray spectrum of AGNs using ray-tracing simulations. Two geometries for the polar gas are considered, (1) a hollow cone corresponding to the best-fitting MIR model and (2) a filled cone, both with varying column densities (ranging from 1021 to 1022.5 cm−2) along with a torus surrounding the central X-ray source. We find that the polar gas leads to an increase in the equivalent width of several fluorescence lines below ∼5 keV (e.g. O, Ne, Mg, Si). A filled geometry is unlikely for the polar component, as the X-ray spectra of many type 1 AGNs would show signatures of obscuration. We also consider extra emission from the narrow-line region such as a scattered power law with many photoionized lines from obscured AGNs, and different opening angles and matter compositions for the hollow cone. These simulations will provide a fundamental benchmark for current and future high spectral resolution X-ray instruments, such as those onboard XRISM and Athena.},

	abstract = {Context
              . Measuring how the physical properties of galaxies change across cosmic times is essential to understand galaxy formation and evolution. With the advent of numerous ground-based and space-borne instruments launched over the past few decades we now have exquisite multi-wavelength observations of galaxies from the far-ultraviolet (FUV) to the radio domain. To tap into this mine of data and obtain new insight into the formation and evolution of galaxies, it is essential that we are able to extract information from their spectral energy distribution (SED).
            
            
              Aims
              . We present a completely new implementation of Code Investigating GALaxy Emission (
              CIGALE
              ). Written in
              python
              , its main aims are to easily and efficiently model the FUV to radio spectrum of galaxies and estimate their physical properties such as star formation rate, attenuation, dust luminosity, stellar mass, and many other physical quantities.
            
            
              Methods
              . To compute the spectral models,
              CIGALE
              builds composite stellar populations from simple stellar populations combined with highly flexible star formation histories, calculates the emission from gas ionised by massive stars, and attenuates both the stars and the ionised gas with a highly flexible attenuation curve. Based on an energy balance principle, the absorbed energy is then re-emitted by the dust in the mid- and far-infrared domains while thermal and non-thermal components are also included, extending the spectrum far into the radio range. A large grid of models is then fitted to the data and the physical properties are estimated through the analysis of the likelihood distribution.
            
            
              Results
              .
              CIGALE
              is a versatile and easy-to-use tool that makes full use of the architecture of multi-core computers, building grids of millions of models and analysing samples of thousands of galaxies, both at high speed. Beyond fitting the SEDs of galaxies and parameter estimations, it can also be used as a model-generation tool or serve as a library to build new applications.},

However, the huge radiative power of most AGN cannot be seen directly, as the accretion is hidden behind gas and dust that absorb many of the characteristic observational signatures. This obscuration presents an important challenge for uncovering the complete AGN population and understanding the cosmic evolution of SMBHs. In this review, we describe a broad range of multiwavelength techniques that are currently being employed to identify obscured AGN, and we assess the reliability and completeness of each technique. We follow with a discussion of the demographics of obscured AGN activity, explore the nature and physical scales of the obscuring material, and assess the implications of obscured AGN for observational cosmology. We conclude with an outline of the prospects for future progress from both observations and theoretical models, and we highlight some of the key outstanding questions.},

              To explore the role environment plays in influencing galaxy evolution at high redshifts, we study

              environments using the FourStar Galaxy Evolution (ZFOURGE) survey. Using galaxies from the COSMOS legacy field with
              
                
                  
                  \$\$\{{\textbackslash}rm\{log\}\}{\textbackslash}left( \{\{\{{\textbackslash}rm\{M\}\}\_\{{\textbackslash}rm\{*\}\}\}/\{\{{\textbackslash}rm\{M\}\}\_ {\textbackslash}odot \}\} {\textbackslash}right) {\textbackslash}geqslant 9.5\$\$
                
              
              , we use a seventh nearest neighbour density estimator to quantify galaxy environment, dividing this into bins of low, intermediate and high density. We discover new high density environment candidates across

              . We analyse the quiescent fraction, stellar mass and specific star formation rate (sSFR) of our galaxies to understand how these vary with redshift and environment. Our results reveal that, across
              
                
                  
                  \$\$2.0 {\textbackslash}le z {\textbackslash}lt 2.4\$\$
                
              
              , the high density environments are the most significant regions, which consist of elevated quiescent fractions,

              galaxies and suppressed star formation activity. At
              
                
                  
                  \$\$3.1 {\textbackslash}le z {\textbackslash}lt 4.2\$\$
                
              
              , we find that high density regions consist of elevated stellar masses but require more complete samples of quiescent and sSFR data to study the effects of environment in more detail at these higher redshifts. Overall, our results suggest that well-evolved, passive galaxies are already in place in high density environments at
